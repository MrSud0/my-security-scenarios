Heartbleed

In this scenario, you will need to gain access to a container running an outdated version of OpenSSL that is susceptible to the Heartbleed vulnerability. The container has a web server running that is vulnerable to the Heartbleed exploit, which allows attackers to read sensitive information from the server's memory.

You will need to use your knowledge of the Heartbleed vulnerability and security concepts to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the container. The container contains a vulnerable web server that you can use as a starting point, as well as hidden clues and Easter eggs that will help you along the way.

To complete the scenario, you will need to find the hidden clues and use Heartbleed techniques to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the container. Be careful, as the container is also hardened to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

Good luck, and have fun!
