Sure, here is a summary of the scenario in Markdown format:
PHP Arbitrary Code Execution

In this scenario, you will need to gain access to a container running a vulnerable version of PHP that is susceptible to arbitrary code execution attacks. The container is running an outdated version of the PHP language, which has a known vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely.

You will need to use a combination of skills and tools to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the container. The container contains a vulnerable PHP script that you can use as a starting point, as well as hidden clues and Easter eggs that will help you along the way.

To complete the scenario, you will need to find the hidden clues and use your knowledge of security concepts to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the container. Be careful, as the container is also hardened to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

Good luck, and have fun!
