In this scenario, you will need to gain access to a container running a web application that is susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The web application has a form that accepts user input, but it does not properly sanitize or validate the input, which makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

You will need to use your knowledge of XSS and security concepts to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the container. The container contains a vulnerable web application that you can use as a starting point, as well as hidden clues and Easter eggs that will help you along the way.

To complete the scenario, you will need to find the hidden clues and use XSS techniques to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the container. Be careful, as the container is also hardened to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

Good luck, and have fun!
